## muffin beer
* Can be based on the [toast ale](http://www.toastale.com/toast-ale-recipe/) recipe.  
* But including muffins, which will add more sugars but also perhaps a mild fruit flavor.

* Adapt your recipe from the [tree leaf wine recipes](https://www.permaculture.co.uk/readers-solutions/how-make-tree-leaf-wines). 
* Or possibly Jack Keller's [oak leaf wine recipe](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/oakleaf.asp)
