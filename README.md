# weird-brews

## muffin beer
* Can be based on the [toast ale](http://www.toastale.com/toast-ale-recipe/) recipe.  
* But including muffins, which will add more sugars but also perhaps a mild fruit flavor.

## duckweed wine
* A green and leafy wine. Will be probably easier if you manage to get a second duckweed tank going. 
* Adapt your recipe from the [tree leaf wine recipes](https://www.permaculture.co.uk/readers-solutions/how-make-tree-leaf-wines).
